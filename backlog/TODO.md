- Consider new sources of ratings
  - Gamespot
  - IGN
- For HowLongToBeat, pull more than just 'Main Story', to handle cases like id
  7236, which has info for 'Main + Extras' and 'Completionist', but not the
  'Main Story'
- For imdb, revamp the script to function like the rest, where you can
  manually set the title id and let it grab the rating

## Wrappers

- Delete Planetside 2. The MMOFPS is now dead.
- Finish fixing SotS
