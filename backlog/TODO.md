## Games Backlog Tasks

- If an auto categorization rule would have applied to place it where it is,
  given the old dest, but no longer would be, then move it out of that
  category into the default location (unsorted). That is, when a game is in
  'Games - Broken' and gets moved into 'Games', it should be removed from '7
  - Not Playing/Broken, Unplayable'.
