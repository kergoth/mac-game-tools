## Current Concerns

- mdls can fail on just one or two files, but we'll fail to get names for any,
  since I wanted to avoid running one mdls process per app.
- Sort order on the gist has changed slightly for no reason I've found thus
  far -- particularly the order of items like Syberia & Syberia 2, and Leisure
  Suit Larry 1 and Leisure Suit Larry 1 VGA. It seems gfind doesn't have
  a sort option, however. It may be worth examining lstree to make sure its
  output is deterministic.
- Resurrect Deponia, Deponia 2, and Akalabeth
